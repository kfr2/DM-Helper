About
-----
DM Helper is a JavaScript-powered web page designed to assist dungeon masters
during combat.  All JavaScript libraries and image files are included because DM Helper
is designed to be functional if an internet connection is not available wherever
the group is running through its campaign.

This small project served as a personal introduction to JavaScript and the jQuery
JavaScript library.  If you notice any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free
to email me at the address above.  Thanks for looking; may all your quests be glorious!
